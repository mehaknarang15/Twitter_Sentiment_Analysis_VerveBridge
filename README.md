The primary objective of this project is to analyze a substantial dataset of tweets, utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to categorize sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral. Through a structured workflow that includes data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and modeling, this analysis not only sheds light on audience reactions but also demonstrates the practical application of data science techniques in understanding social media dynamics. Ultimately, the insights gained from this project can serve as a foundation for further research and applications in sentiment analysis within the broader context of social media analytics.
